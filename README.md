# matreePy
Cython API for the [Mutation Annotated Tree (MAT) Online Phylogenetics Toolkit](https://github.com/yatisht/usher) (In Early Development). Developer version distributed as source. 

# Overview
This repository will allow the user to leverage the power of the Mutation Annotated Tree file format and library in their Python scripts, allowing for efficient and effective analysis of global SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogen phylogenies. 

UCSC maintains a daily-updated mutation-annotated tree in protobuf format containing all publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences [here](http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/wuhCor1/UShER_SARS-CoV-2/). To try out this tool, download the latest tree, build the library, and jump straight to your Python analysis!

## Core Dependencies

Cython 

Boost

Protobuf

tbb 2019

Conda is required for environment and dependency management.

You will also need the general suite of C++ compiler tools. On a mac, you will need xcode CLI. On linux, you may need other compiler tools. You may want to call 
```
conda install -c conda-forge cxx-compiler
conda install -c anaconda make 
```
If you don't have make/cmake, clang/gcc and related available.

## Build Instructions

### First Time Setup

This project is dependent on a few key libraries that need to be available for linking. We use conda for environment management, so you will need miniconda or anaconda. 

The first step is to clone this repository. This repository relies on UShER as a submodule dependency, so --recurse-submodules
needs to be added to the call.

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/jmcbroome/matreePy 
```

If you forgot to add this argument to your git clone call, you can run the following in the cloned repository.

```
git submodule update --init
```

The next step is to prepare the environment and all relevant dependencies.

```
conda env create -f matreepy.yml
```

If the .yml isn't working for you, you can try:

```
conda create --name matreepy
conda activate matreepy
conda install -c conda-forge -c anaconda protobuf boost-cpp cython tbb-devel=2019.0
```

### Building the Python-importable library

Once all libraries are available, proceed to compile the .so.

```
python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

If successful, you can now import from the .so into your python environment with 

```
import mat
```

From a script in the same directory as the .so!

### Example Usage

To ensure the library is built and working correctly, you can obtain the latest global mutation annotated tree from the repository linked above and call our test script.

```
wget http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/wuhCor1/UShER_SARS-CoV-2/public-latest.all.masked.pb.gz
python3 test.py
```
